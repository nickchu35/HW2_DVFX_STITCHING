======================================================================

Program procedues:
1. Cylindrical Reprojection from raw images
2. Feature Finding
3. Feature Descriptor
4. Feature Matching
5. RANSAC Algorithm
6. Image Blendgin and Stitching

Folders:
1. cylin_photos	: Store the images after cylindrical reprojection.
2. mat 			: Store the processed feature information in .mat format for later use.
3. result_photos: Store the blended images between two adjacent scenes and final result of panorama.
4. source_photos: Store the source photos to be made into panorama.

How to use:
There are several flags in the beginning of main.m
1. make_new_cylindrical			: If true, perform cylindrical reprojection on the source photos and store them.
2. run_feature_detection		: If true, run Harris corner detection and generate feature Descriptors.
3. run_feature_matching			: If true, matches previous found feature points between adjacent images.
4. blend_1_by_1_and_show_result	: If true, will show the blending of adjacent photos and store them.
